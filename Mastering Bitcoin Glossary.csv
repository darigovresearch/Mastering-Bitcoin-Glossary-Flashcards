"address (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A bitcoin address looks like +1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV+. It consists of a string of letters and numbers starting with a ""1"" (number one). Just like you ask others to send an email to your email address, you would ask others to send you bitcoin to your bitcoin address.(((""bitcoin address"")))(((""address", see="bitcoin address"")))(((""public key", see="bitcoin address"")))
"
"bip (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"Bitcoin Improvement Proposals.  A set of proposals that members of the bitcoin community have submitted to improve bitcoin.  For example, BIP0021 is a proposal to improve the bitcoin uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme.(((""bip""))) 
"
"bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The name of the currency unit (the coin), the network, and the software.(((""bitcoin""))) 
"
"block (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A grouping of transactions, marked with a timestamp, and a fingerprint of the previous block. The block header is hashed to produce a proof of work, thereby validating the transactions. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by network consensus.(((""block"")))
"
"blockchain (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A list of validated blocks, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.(((""blockchain"")))
"
"confirmations (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. As soon as _another_ block is mined on the same blockchain, the transaction has two confirmations, and so on. Six or more confirmations is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed.(((""confirmations"")))
"
"difficulty (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A network-wide setting that controls how much computation is required to produce a proof of work.(((""difficulty"")))
"
"difficulty target (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A difficulty at which all the computation in the network will find blocks approximately every 10 minutes.(((""target difficulty"")))
"
"difficulty retargeting (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A network-wide recalculation of the difficulty that occurs once every 2,106 blocks and considers the hashing power of the previous 2,106 blocks.(((""difficulty retargeting"")))
"
"fees (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The sender of a transaction often includes a fee to the network for processing the requested transaction.  Most transactions require a minimum fee of 0.5 mBTC.(((""fees"")))
"
"hash (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A digital fingerprint of some binary input.(((""hash"")))
"
"genesis block (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The first block in the blockchain, used to initialize the cryptocurrency.(((""genesis block"")))
"
"miner (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.(((""miner"")))
"
"network (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A peer-to-peer network that propagates transactions and blocks to every bitcoin node on the network.(((""network"")))
"
"Proof-Of-Work (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A piece of data that requires significant computation to find. In bitcoin, miners must find a numeric solution to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide target, the difficulty target. (((""proof-of-work"")))
"
"reward (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"An amount included in each new block as a reward by the network to the miner who found the Proof-Of-Work solution. It is currently 25BTC per block.(((""reward"")))
"
"secret key (aka private key) (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The secret number that unlocks bitcoins sent to the corresponding address.  A secret key looks like +5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh+.(((""secret key"")))(((""private key", see="secret key"")))
"
"transaction (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"In simple terms, a transfer of bitcoins from one address to another. More precisely, a transaction is a signed data structure expressing a transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the bitcoin network, collected by miners, and included into blocks, made permanent on the blockchain.(((""transaction"")))
"
"wallet (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"Software that holds all your bitcoin addresses and secret keys. Use it to send, receive, and store your bitcoin.(((""wallet"")))
