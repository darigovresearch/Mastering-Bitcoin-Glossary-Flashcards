"Introduction (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"
<p>This deck has taken definitions outlined in <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/Edition1Print2"">Mastering Bitcoin's first edition Glossary</a> and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/"">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Please note the modifications which have been made &amp; where you can find updates.</p>
<ol align=""left"">
<li>The front of every card has ""(Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"" appended to the end so that if you have any other words in your collection, the Mastering Bitcoin Glossary definition will still be added when importing it.</li>
<li>Any updates, translations or corrections to the deck will be available at <a href=""https://github.com/darigovresearch/Mastering-Bitcoin-Glossary-Flashcards""></a><a href=""https://github.com/darigovresearch/Mastering-Bitcoin-Glossary-Flashcards"">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Mastering-Bitcoin-Glossary-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.</li>

"
"address (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A bitcoin address looks like +1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV+. It consists of a string of letters and numbers starting with a ""1"" (number one). Just like you ask others to send an email to your email address, you would ask others to send you bitcoin to your bitcoin address.
"
"bip (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"Bitcoin Improvement Proposals.  A set of proposals that members of the bitcoin community have submitted to improve bitcoin.  For example, BIP0021 is a proposal to improve the bitcoin uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme.
"
"bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The name of the currency unit (the coin), the network, and the software.
"
"block (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A grouping of transactions, marked with a timestamp, and a fingerprint of the previous block. The block header is hashed to produce a proof of work, thereby validating the transactions. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by network consensus.
"
"blockchain (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A list of validated blocks, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.
"
"confirmations (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. As soon as _another_ block is mined on the same blockchain, the transaction has two confirmations, and so on. Six or more confirmations is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed.
"
"difficulty (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A network-wide setting that controls how much computation is required to produce a proof of work.
"
"difficulty target (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A difficulty at which all the computation in the network will find blocks approximately every 10 minutes.
"
"difficulty retargeting (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A network-wide recalculation of the difficulty that occurs once every 2,106 blocks and considers the hashing power of the previous 2,106 blocks.
"
"fees (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The sender of a transaction often includes a fee to the network for processing the requested transaction.  Most transactions require a minimum fee of 0.5 mBTC.
"
"hash (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A digital fingerprint of some binary input.
"
"genesis block (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The first block in the blockchain, used to initialize the cryptocurrency.
"
"miner (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.
"
"network (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A peer-to-peer network that propagates transactions and blocks to every bitcoin node on the network.
"
"Proof-Of-Work (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"A piece of data that requires significant computation to find. In bitcoin, miners must find a numeric solution to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide target, the difficulty target. 
"
"reward (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"An amount included in each new block as a reward by the network to the miner who found the Proof-Of-Work solution. It is currently 25BTC per block.
"
"secret key (aka private key) (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"The secret number that unlocks bitcoins sent to the corresponding address.  A secret key looks like +5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh+.
"
"transaction (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"In simple terms, a transfer of bitcoins from one address to another. More precisely, a transaction is a signed data structure expressing a transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the bitcoin network, collected by miners, and included into blocks, made permanent on the blockchain.
"
"wallet (Mastering Bitcoin Glossary)"|"Software that holds all your bitcoin addresses and secret keys. Use it to send, receive, and store your bitcoin.
